This was a colloborated project between Forge Start Up Acccelerator and my Undergraduate Universityy.

The main aim of thhhe poject was to develop an automaated E-Charging system for EV Vehicles.

I developed a CAN Communication Network between a charging station and the Battery Management System (both of which were controlled by a Controller).

Then I introduced a Gui based Touch screen system which was interfaced to raspberry pi. So the Controller from the Charging station will notify the Pi processor about the total time and amount of power consmed to chartge the Vehicle.

With this data, the Pi processor, will calculate the price based on the watts consumed and timing of the charge and the payment options will be displayed.
